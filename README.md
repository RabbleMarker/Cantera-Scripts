# Cantera & CoolProp Thermodynamic Comparisons

This repository mainly contains Jupyter notebook scripts comparing thermodynamic properties using Canteras and CoolProps integrated Equations of State (EOS)
It includes thermodynamic property comparisons of pure substances, mixtures, as well as my attempts at combustion simulations.

[http://www.coolprop.org/coolprop/wrappers/Python/index.html#automatic-installation] on installing the CoolProp Package

## Installing conda:
bash <conda-installer-name>-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh    (Edit the command to reflect which conda package you've downloaded)

## Installing cantera, ipython, matplotlib, jupyter
conda create --name ct-env --channel conda-forge cantera ipython matplotlib jupyter
# To use the created environment, run
conda activate ct-env

## Installing CoolProp
conda install conda-forge::coolprop
